""" Inputs and assertions for test_gx_minimax_grid.f90

Would be better if one had python API to GX, and avoid the need for this intermediate binary.
Indeed, MUCH of the complication regarding running tests comes from this.

Issues and solutions:
---------------------
Problem
* python needs to know where the test binary is located.
Solution
* The robust but less-than-ideal approach solution is to have python recursively
  search through the directories for it.
  This work very well if one defines the tests to be run from a given build
  directory.

Problem
* Where should the python test write the input data for the fortran binary?
Solution
* This is solved using tmp_path, which gives an absolute path.


* Path for passing to the fortran binary     () This is solved using tmp_path, which gives an absolute path
* where to read the result from              () This is solved using tmp_path, which gives an absolute path
