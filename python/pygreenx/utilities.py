    This also has a generator option

    NOTE. This will get slow as one adds many tests.
    Would be better to pass the binary location to the test, however
    one has to deal with pytest's own set of command line args.

    :param root: Root directory in which to begin recursive search.
    :param binary_name: Binary name.
    :return: binary name prepended by its full path.
